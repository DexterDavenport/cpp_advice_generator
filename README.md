# Overview

This is my first real attempt at a C++ code. I wanted to try and make a simple code but to add in a few key elements of the language that could help me out later on. This way I am able to practice a little bit before I start using it for real word application. 

This Software is basically an advice companion but with a twist. You can choose if you would like it to be encouraging, rude, or just undecisive. Use it when you want to have some positive encouragement for a task, or to talk you out of something that you know you shouldn't do. 

A visual deminstration of the code is available [here](link here)

# Development Environment

* Visual Studio Code
* C++ 17
* Git/Githun

# Libraries

# Future Work

Some of the things I want to do in the future with this code are:
